# ofxMacOSScreenSaver

Easily turn any OF project into an OSX screen saver.
This is a horrible Frankenstein mess that started from code scavanged from OF forums & Nick Hardeman's blog post on. OF changed a lot from then, so I am having to rewrite most of it.

So far I have multi-screen and retina support working, but it needs a proper interface for easy integration.


Note that this is not currently setup to place your project inside the OpenFrameworks/apps folder, but outside the OpenFrameworks folder. All the magic happens in the `ScreenSaverOF.xcconfig` file.

Very much a WIP!
